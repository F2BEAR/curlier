# Curlier ðŸ“¦

The courier for your curl requests.

A minimal, extendable and flexible CLI tool to execute saved requests using curl.

## Usage

Once installed you can run:

```shell
./curlier.sh <request_name>
```

All your requests are just `.sh` files that you must store under the `requests/` folder.

This makes curlier really eassy to extend and customize to your needs; request files are just shell scripts so you can make with them whatever you want.

You can configure the default requests directory inside your shell configuration file (ie: .bashrc, .zshrc, etc).

```bash
# In .zshrc, .bashrc, etc.
export CURLIER_REQUESTS_DIR="/path/to/your/custom/requests/dir"
```

## Flags

There are only two flags available for the moment:

- `--list | -l` list the available requests inside the ./requests/ folder.
- `--params | -p` Sends params to the request file as env vars.

The `--params` flag can only be used if an available request name is put before the flag and it accepts key/value pairs:

```shell
curlier example --params foo=bar
```

## Request Examples

> **Note:** There are some examples in the `./requests/` folder

The most basic example of a request file is as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

curl -X GET "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
```

You can combine this with whatever you want; for example, you can use `jq` to parse the json response from `jsonplaceholder`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

curl -X GET "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users" \
  | jq
```

### Using the `--params` flag

Curlier parses the key/value pairs that follows the params flag and saves them into an string called `URL_PARAMS` which is available as an env bar.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# curlier example -p id=1
curl -X GET "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users?${URL_PARAMS}" # this will return the user with id=1 from jsonplaceholder
```

### Using env vars

Curlier also support the usage of .env files to add secrets to your requests, so you can save your requests in your repository without sharing sensitive information like access tokens.

They can be stored in your `/request/` folder or in it's child folders if you have specific folders for each of your apis (ie: /requests/project1/.env, /requests/.env, /requests/proyect2/.env, etc).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/usrs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
```
